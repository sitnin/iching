# I-Ching birth/core/end hexagram calculation library

This is a static c/c++ library for calculation birth/core/end hexagram numbers.

## Node.JS

As usual, you can just install the library via npm

`npm install iching`

### Known problems

Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS node.js package seems not to have a node-gyp, so it must be installed prior to the library

`sudo npm install -g node-gyp`
